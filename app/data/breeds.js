    "🐺 Their coat is so thick that it acts as 'armor'—wolves could not bite through the cords to reach the dog's skin",
    "🧼 Despite looking like a mop, they are quite clean; they don't have a typical doggy odor, and the cords repel dirt",
    "📏 A full-grown Komondor can have up to 2,000 cords, which can weigh up to 15 lbs!",
    "🏛️ They were almost extinct after WWII because they defended their properties so fiercely that invading armies had to shoot them to enter",
